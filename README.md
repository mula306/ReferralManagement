# ReferralManagement
ReferralManagement
The ReferralManagement project is a software solution aimed at managing referrals within an organization or system. The project is designed with a focus on robustness and scalability, and it's primarily built using C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Project Structure
The project is divided into two main components:
ReferralAPI: This component presumably acts as the backend of the project, providing an interface for managing and processing referral information. It is likely to include functionalities related to referral generation, tracking, and assignment. The latest commit for this component, titled "Added Provider Assignment Service / Not implemented", suggests that the system may also involve provider assignment services, although this feature is not yet implemented as of the latest update on May 29, 2023​1​.
ReferralManagement: This component appears to be responsible for referral management tasks. The most recent commit message, "Added Referral Edit, moved endpoints to endpoint folder", indicates that the project allows for editing referrals and organizes different endpoints into a dedicated folder, suggesting a well-structured API design​1​.
